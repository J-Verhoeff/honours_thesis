This game is a proof of concept game to help people to learn about the culture of North American Indigenous peoples. I identified that there was a huge lack of representation in video games for Indigenous people. Therefore, I want to make a game that not only provides a source of good representation for Indidenous peoples, but also a source for people to learn about the rich and varied culture. I worked with the Ontario Tech Indigenous Education and Cultural Services to create an idea for a game that would work. We ended up coming up with a game that will resemble Animal Crossing, or Stardew Valley, called Turtle Island.

<br>

The goal of the game is build up your town and learn about different aspects of Indigenous culture through a variety of mini games. The mini games that are currently being worked on are a fishing mini game, and a gathureing and crafting mini game.

Controls:

- **WASD** movement
- **LShift** to sprint
- **Space** to jump
- **Q** to interact
- **P** to pause
- **Left Click** to interact with NPC's and play mini games

<br>

Current Issues:

- Menu buttons on pause menu are not interactable, not sure why
- Stabbing animation for spear fishing is not lining up with the action
- Raycast for dectecting a hit on a fish while spear fishing is not working
- Haveing trouble with the new Unity Input system, buttons not being recognized when unselected
- Scene transistions when entering and leaving the fishing minigame are not working all of the time
    - Scene is transitioning, but the player is not being moved to the needed location
